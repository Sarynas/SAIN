Saryn's Absolutely Inoperative Nonsense

This is a client mod that allows you to click a checkbox in the client mod settings. It's literally just a checkbox. 

It's an April Fool's Joke.

If you install and run this it'll just be a checkbox in the BepInEx settings menu. It's a checkbox with no function.

Happy April Fools!
